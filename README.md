# Customer Segmentation and Recommendation Engine

This project implements a customer segmentation and recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform. The aim is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics using clustering techniques and then use classification algorithms to recommend personalized products to each customer segment.

## Overview

In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to enhance the customer experience and drive sales by providing tailored product recommendations. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Customer Segmentation**: Customers are grouped into distinct segments based on their similarities in features such as age, income, and purchase history. We employ KMeans clustering for segmentation, which helps us identify homogeneous groups of customers.

2. **Model Training**: For each customer segment, we train a logistic regression model to predict the probability of a customer purchasing a specific product. These models learn from historical data and are trained to provide personalized recommendations.

3. **Recommendation Generation**: Using the trained models, we generate personalized product recommendations for customers in the test set. These recommendations are based on the predicted probabilities of purchase for each customer segment.

4. **Evaluation**: We evaluate the accuracy of our recommendations by comparing the predicted probabilities with the actual purchase behavior of customers in the test set. This helps us assess the effectiveness of our recommendation engine.

## Usage

To use the customer segmentation and recommendation engine:

1. **Data Preparation**: Replace the synthetic data with your actual customer data. Ensure that the data includes relevant features such as age, income, purchase history, and a target variable indicating product purchases.

2. **Model Training**: Train the KMeans clustering model to segment customers and the logistic regression models for personalized product recommendations. Adjust parameters as needed to optimize performance.

3. **Recommendation Generation**: Use the trained models to generate personalized product recommendations for customers in the test set.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the accuracy of the recommendations to assess the effectiveness of the recommendation engine.
